#Age discount
#Your goal: Create a program that takes in the users age then the amount of money
#If the users age is 65 or over they get a 15% discount
#If they are younger than 65 inform them they do not get a discount
#
#
#Hints: You will need two inputs to get both the age and amount of money
#you will also need an if statment to check if the age is 65 or older
